Hi Bobbie,
 
The “Procedures and Job Aids” link and the Reports link on the Planning and Performance Measures page jumps to Compliance Standards https://dorsp13.fdor.dor.state.fl.us/sites/gta/rm/polproc/Pages/AboutUs.aspx
 
We’ve indicated weblinks that ought to be deleted - see attached spreadsheet.   Also, we added comments in column L to give you an idea when specific reports will be updated.  
 
Please modify the last sentence in the survey process narrative on the landing  page to read:  “The process ends with an actionable report of data and information.” instead of “The process ends with a report of the data or information collected in a useable form.”  Thanks.
